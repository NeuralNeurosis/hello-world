# hello-world
This is the first time I have done this and have no idea what I am doing.
My name is Dane Nagy;
I am a non-tradition student that went back to school after quite a few years. I have explored a lot of different subjects and skills and could not settle on one but have been interested in code for quite a while. I just recently decided to start html5 on codecademy and just yesterday finished the first course on html5/css. I am now on to the next step of the journey by starting free codecamp to keep developing my frontend web skills and maybe learn some actual backend stuff too eventually. Though I do have to say the front end stuff excites me the most right now but that is because I have not really had a chance to understand anything about real software or data coding. Thanks for reading.

This is the first time I have checked this repository since I started it just to acclimate my self to git hub. It has now been a full 2 years and I am working as a honest to God web developer. I have finished my bachelors degree and also me and Emily have purchased a house. I am trying to further familiarize my self with programing and programing tools so I am exploring github today and electron so I can possibly build in house desktop apps for Apollo my new job. I feel really grateful and happy that I was able to find this position and took the leap to apply for it.

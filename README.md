# hello-world
This is the first time I have done this and have no idea what I am doing.
My name is Dane Nagy;
I am a non-tradition student that went back to school after quite a few years. I have explored a lot of different subjects and skills and could not settle on one but have been interested in code for quite a while. I just recently decided to start html5 on codecademy and just yesterday finished the first course on html5/css. I am now on to the next step of the journey by starting free codecamp to keep developing my frontend web skills and maybe learn some actual backend stuff too eventually. Though I do have to say the front end stuff excites me the most right now but that is because I have not really had a chance to understand anything about real software or data coding. Thanks for reading.
